# Cluster-Resource-Optimization-in-OpenShift
Objectives
Understand resource requests and limits.
Implement resource quotas and limit ranges.
Monitor and manage resource utilization.

Task 1: Set Resource Requests and Limits for Pods
Objective: Set resource requests and limits for a set of pods.
Explanation: Resource requests and limits define the amount of CPU and memory resources a container can use. Setting these appropriately ensures optimal performance and prevents resource contention.

Task 2: Configure and Manage Resource Quotas for a Namespace
Objective: Configure and manage resource quotas for a namespace.
Explanation: Resource quotas limit the aggregate resource consumption per namespace. Configuring and managing them ensures fair resource distribution and prevents overconsumption.

Use Monitoring Tools to Observe Resource Utilization
Additionally, monitoring can be done using setting up popular monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) and how they can be integrated into OpenShift and Kubernetes
